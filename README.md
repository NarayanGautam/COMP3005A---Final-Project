## How to run the program
## Step 1: Setup the database in PostgreSQL
Create the Fitness Club database in PostgreSQL by running the following commands in psql or using the GUI in pgAdmin4.
```sql
create database fitness_club;
```

## Step 2: Setup the database tables
Run the ``ddl.sql`` file by uploading it in pgAdmin4 and running it. This will create all the tables and constraints in the database. You can also right click on the database in pgAdmin4 and click on ``Query Tool`` and copy and paste the contents of the ``ddl.sql`` file and run it directly in the query tool.

## Step 3: Populate the database and query the database
Open the ``sqlCommands.sql`` file and run the commands in the file to populate the database and query the database for data.
