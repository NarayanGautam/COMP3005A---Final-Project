## How to run the program
## Step 1: Setup the database in PostgreSQL
Create the Fitness Club database in PostgreSQL by running the following commands in psql or using the GUI in pgAdmin4.
```sql
create database fitness_club;
```

## Step 2: Setup the database tables
Run the ``ddl.sql`` file by uploading it in pgAdmin4 and running it. This will create all the tables and constraints in the database.

## Step 3: Populate the database and query the database
Open the ``sqlCommands.sql`` file and run the commands in the file to populate the database and query the database.
